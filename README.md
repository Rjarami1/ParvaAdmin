Desktop App built with electron for managing a bakery.

This is a personal project for one of my job partners which has a bakery and asked me to develop a desktop app for him to manage his bakery.
He wants everything to be local (Including a database). I thought this was a great opportunity to try electron since I love to programm in Javascript. 

Im using PostgreSQL as my database engine.
